NOTES:
- not sure how to best to combine data with different wavelength resolutions,
  currently downsampling to the lowest possible resolution (?)

TODO:
- see in-text TODOs and xxx
- add pie charts or waterfall plots for loss analysis
- move some helper functions to another module?
- change load functions into pure functions returning dictionaries, then use
decorators to load attributes?
- user input for some parameters (eg. wafer thickness)
- create dependency tree for calculations (QE and IV are almost separate)
- robust to having missing data?
- should some methods be converted to in class functions? ie: wl_to_alpha
- return covariance for every fitting parameter?
- easily compare different samples

Coding notes:
- Q: Why don't the methods to load data return values instead of setting class
    attributes, doesn't this make this code less reusable?
    - Ans: These methods are only run once per instance and do not have any
    feedback, so they are stable. This code should be self contained, so will
    not be reused elsewhere.
- Q: Why do the process functions return function objects?
    - Ans: To make the functions 'pure functions' and more reusable
