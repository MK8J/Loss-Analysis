NOTES:
- not sure how to best to combine data with different wavelength resolutions,
  currently downsampling to the lowest possible resolution (?)

TODO:
- see in-text TODOs and xxx
- fix openpyxl install
- write tests, at least for functions in analysis.py
- add pie charts or waterfall plots for loss analysis
- arbitrary input params, to plot against separately? (perhaps too much work)
- create dependency tree for calculations (QE and IV are almost separate)
- robust to having missing data?
- return covariance for every fitting parameter?
- easily compare different samples
